# Micro-Expression Recognition Using Attention-Driven Deep Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on micro-expression recognition using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). The model is trained on the **SAMM dataset** to capture subtle facial expressions, significantly improving classification accuracy.

## Features
- **Attention Mechanism:** Integrated CBAM with CNN to enhance feature extraction and improve recognition accuracy.
- **Model Performance:** Achieved a **14% accuracy improvement**, increasing from **80% (CNN) to 94% (CNN+CBAM)**.
- **Explainability:** Used **Grad-CAM** to interpret model decisions and visualize important features.
- **Optimized Training:** Trained on **256Ã—256** images, with **8.41M parameters** over **15 epochs**.
- **Micro-Expression Classification:** Successfully classified **six micro-expressions**, contributing to advancements in facial emotion analysis.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** SAMM (Spontaneous Micro-Expression Database)
- **Preprocessing:** Images resized to **256Ã—256** for uniform input size.
- **Augmentation:** Applied transformations for better generalization.

## Model Architecture
- **Baseline Model:** CNN-based classifier.
- **Enhanced Model:** CNN + CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to refine feature extraction.
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
- **Optimizer:** Adam optimizer for efficient convergence.

## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```
### Running the Model
